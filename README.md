## 🧩 Planned Features

- Support for more AI Providers (See current progress for list of supported providers)

---

## 🚀 Current Progress

### Ollama (SelfHostedProvider)
This is the provider I use most in my own projects. For this reason, I have naturally tested most of the features related to this provider. 

### OpenAI (OpenAIProvider)
I have placehoder code for the OpenAI API, but I don't have a key to test it. Will be updated when I have a project to use it for.

### Gemini (Google)
No implementation yet. Likely to consider implementation soon cause I have been using their trial recently.
